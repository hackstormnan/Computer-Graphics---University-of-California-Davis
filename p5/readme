"Hey there!

For this exciting project, I delved into the realm of OpenGL to master the art of rendering pixel buffers. It's worth noting that no OpenGL math was involved in this endeavor.

In this assignment, I ambitiously set out to implement five distinct surfaces, each adding its unique flavor to the visual tapestry:

1. **Plane**
2. **Sphere**
3. **Triangle**
4. **Cube**
5. **Tetrahedron** (although the epic ellipsoid intersection remained a challenge to conquer)

For the input, I skillfully utilized an XML file stored in the `RayTracer/inputs/scene1.xml` folder.

I'm thrilled to showcase the breathtaking results with sample images already available in the `SampleOutput` folder. Additionally, there's a captivating picture portraying the outcome of rendering a random scene in the skeleton code - a cool feature I couldn't resist sharing.

Now, let's unravel the captivating scene:

- A majestic plane featuring a phong material stands resolute on the ground.
- A cube graces the forefront, captivating the viewer with its dielectric material.
- The middle stage boasts three spheres adorned with materials ranging from matel to dielectric, concluding with a classic phong material.
- A triumphant tetrahedron embraces a phong material, nestled in the left backdrop.
- In the right rear, a cube proudly showcases its matel material.
- A charming triangle flaunts a phong material in the left background.

Adding to the magic are three illuminating lights: ambient, directional, and point light. These lights orchestrate a symphony of shadows, gracing the ground with two mesmerizing shadows. (Please note that shadow cast wisely sidesteps dielectric material.)

With each pixel, this project embarks on a journey of light, shadow, and intricate surfaces, culminating in a mesmerizing visual spectacle."
