Hey there! Welcome to The Cherno Engine Manual. I've delved into rendering concepts, inspired by my favorite YouTuber 'The Cherno' and his enlightening OpenGL playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2.

The rendering engine harnesses the power of the following components:

GLEW and
GLFW for establishing the OpenGL framework setup.
GLM library, enabling the use of glm::vec3 and glm::mat4 structures for efficient vertex and matrix storage.
ImGUI library for simplified UI interaction, facilitating entity transformations.
Engine Manual:

Getting Started: Simply fire up 'Chreno.sln' and hit F5 to initiate the application under the (x86) configuration setting within Visual Studio.

Cameras: The scene boasts four distinct cameras:

Top Left: Projective
Top Right: Orthographic - XY plane
Bottom Left: Orthographic - XZ plane
Bottom Right: Orthographic - YZ plane
Entities: The engine loads three objects specified in 'Assets/Objs/Objects.txt'. Switch between them effortlessly using the designated button.

Property Window: The Transform Editor window, an ImGUI-powered tool, empowers you to manipulate the transformation properties of the entities.

Toggle between entities by clicking the buttons below the Entity List.

To adjust the position, Euler angles, or scale of the selected entity, simply drag the bars within the Transform Editor.

Scene Saving: Press SPACE to save the scene, preserving the current vertices of all entities in 'Assets/Objs/Objects.txt'.

Properties saved in the previous session will be reloaded upon engine startup.
(Please note that, in this project, vertices are saved instead of transformations. Consequently, upon engine restart, transformations reset to the default, though the relative shapes of objects remain unaffected.)
